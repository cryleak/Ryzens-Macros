# Ryzens-Macros-Public-Edition
Very fast PVP macros written in AHK. You can't have the source code because fuck you. These are the fastest macros possible (probably?)

These macros may boost FPS on low end rigs, and it may reduce FPS because of some commands that increase macro speed but put more strain on your CPU.

These macros have a GUI for setting hotkeys and going into CEO mode, so you don't need the source code anyways. Make a issue if something doesn't work. Also you need a 64-bit computer to run this but if you can run GTA V you probably can run 64-bit macros.

I am left handed so the default binds are horrendous, also some shit might have errors by default, but change it to something else, and I'm too lazy to fix it.

Terribly obfuscated so you can try getting the source code yourself, probably not very hard.

There is a short guide on how to add extra macros. You probably won't get it unless you already know how to make macros, but I suggest taking a look at the CEO mode tutorial.
