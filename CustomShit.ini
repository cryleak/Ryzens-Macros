You can put incredibly basic macros here. Do not include the send command, these macros only let you send inputs, example below. This is because I have to use a variable to do this, instead of Include.
Here are some suggestions:
Use the chat macro if you are gonna make chat macros, they are way faster. Note that you don't need to add a t input at the start, and that you don't need an enter command either.
This is an issue with AHK compiling scripts, can't fix.
DO NOT MAKE THE CODE EMPTY. YOU CAN UNBIND THEM INSTEAD (by pressing DELETE/DEL on your keyboard)
Example macros below:
[Macro1]
{mbutton}{f24 30}{right}{f24 2}{down}{enter}{f24 5}{enter}{f24 5}{enter}{f24 5}{enter}{lbutton 55}{m}{enter}{up}{enter}{f24 7}{m}{up}{enter}
[Macro2]
{lbutton}{o down}{f24 30}g{o up}{f24 10}{esc}{lbutton 10}{f24 55}42{tab}
[Macro3]
{- down}{f24 50}{- up}
[Macro4]
vu
[Macro5]
send p{f24 5}e{f24 25}{enter}{f24 15}{up 4}{f24 10}{enter}{f24 5}{up 6}{f24 10}{enter}
[Macro6]
{alt down}{f24 5}{alt up}{f24 3}
[ChatMacro1]
I'm obese
[ChatMacro2]
I'm gay
